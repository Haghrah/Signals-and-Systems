## Signals and Systems with Python and Octave

On this page, I will provide some examples concerning the signals and systems course. These examples are in Python and Octave languages. Also, there will be some descriptions for each of them.

### Sampling

In this example we are going to ...

```python

from numpy import (sin, )

def signal(t):
    return sin(t)

def sample(func, n, T):
    return 

```

The output plots for this example would be as ...
